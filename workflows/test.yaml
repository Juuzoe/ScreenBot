# ==========================================
# This is a sample ScreenBot yaml
#------------------------------------------
# This file shows how to tell ScreenBot
# what to do, step by step.
#
#
# You can copy and edit this file to make
# your own automations later.
#
# But generally I made it as a guide to follow, its best to create one from scratch for your own needs
# ------------------------------------------

defaults:
  # how often to look at the screen (in milliseconds)
  poll_interval_ms: 200

  # give up after this many seconds if nothing is found
  max_wait_seconds: 10

  # set dry_run: true if you just want to
  # watch logs without real clicks.
  dry_run: false

# ------------------------------------------
# Each "phase" is a small routine that repeats.
# You can have one or many of them.
##for conviniece name "phase1", "phase2", etc.
# ------------------------------------------
phases:
  demo_phase:
    name: "Simple button test"

    # how many times to run this group of actions
    repeats: 3

    # these add random pauses so it feels human
    step_min_sec: 0.5
    step_max_sec: 0.6
    cycle_min_sec: 1.0
    cycle_max_sec: 1.2

    # what bot does each time
    steps:
      - name: "Click first button"
        condition:
          template_path: assets/button1.png  # what to look for on screen
          confidence: 0.9                   # how sure bot needs to be (0â€“1)
        action:
          type: click                       # what to do when bot founds it

      - name: "Click second button"
        condition:
          template_path: assets/button2.png
          confidence: 0.9
        action:
          type: click

      - name: "Click third button"
        condition:
          template_path: assets/button3.png
          confidence: 0.9
        action:
          type: click

# ------------------------------------------
# process:
# - the bot looks for each image in order
# - if it finds it, it clicks
# - it waits a little between actions
# - after all 3, it repeats the phase 3 times
